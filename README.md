Near-Duplicate Detection using Neural Network Features
======================================================

Written as part of a class project on near-duplicate detection for videos, this project is a Matlab script that uses [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) neural networks to generate descriptive features for video frames. These descriptive features provide a unique signature for videos that can be queried to find similar or near-duplicate videos, even after various distortions, including resizing, rotating and cropping.

A summary of the technique and results can be found in the 
[report](https://www.nathanntg.com/writing/cnn-duplicate-video-detection.pdf).
