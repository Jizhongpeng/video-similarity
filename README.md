Near-Duplicate Detection using Neural Network Features
======================================================

Written as part of a class project on near-duplicate detection for videos, this project is a Matlab script that uses [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) neural networks to generate descriptive features for video frames. More details will be added as the project progresses.
